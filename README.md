"# Home-Automation-Using-Google-Assistance" 
Hyy guys, It is home automation using node-red('node-red-contrib-nora' library required), ESP32 module, Relay module, some wires and Arduino IDE for programming ESP32 module.
In this projects, I have connected two home appliances to google assistance i.e. Bulb and Fan.
Appliances can also be controlled using Google Home app and Node-Red Dashboard.
Firstly, I have taken Token from "https://node-red-google-home.herokuapp.com/" after registering with my google account.
And then I programmed ESP32 and Node-Red flow editor.
After this, all was set.
